## [Live Demo](https://shivshanker.pythonanywhere.com/)
This is a dynamic web app that handles many to many relationships between models and authentication system is used for creation and updation of data.  
This web app handles 5 models(Tables) *User* models is main model and other models extends the functionality of *User* model other models are as following-
- Projects
- Resumes
- Social Profiles

> CRUD -- `Creation Retrieval Updation Deletion`
## Features:
- User can register themselves
- User can change their passwords
- User can reset their password if forgot (process is handles using SMTP )
- Authenticated user can add new Projects
- User can delete or edit details of their Projects
- User can update Resume
- User can add new social profile links
- Anyone can contact the owner. (Process is handled using SMTP)
## New Features I would like to add: 
With a slight change of code and a small variation this project could handle multiple user accounts. That is, many users can use it for their portfolio without writing a single line of code.
